# my-spicetify-snippets

Collection of Spicetify CSS snippets to customize your Spotify desktop client. These snippets are tested with the `Blacksuan19` theme.

## Contents

- `index.css` — combined stylesheet with all tweaks.
- `snippets/` — per-tweak files (one file per tweak).
- `preview/` — contains before and after screenshots for visual comparison.

## Usage

1. Open the [Spicetify Marketplace](https://spicetify.app/).
2. Go to the **Themes** tab and download the default `Blacksuan19` theme.
3. Navigate to the **Snippets** tab.
4. Click **Add CSS** at the bottom-right of the section.
5. Copy the contents of `index.css` from this repository and paste it into the editor.

To disable a tweak, remove or comment out its block from the custom CSS and re-run the apply command.
