/* 09 - Queue Top Side Panel
 *
 * Move the Queue section to the top of the right-side (Now Playing) panel
 * by reordering other sections via flexbox `order`.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Save this file as `snippets/09-queue-top-side-panel.css` and paste its
 *   contents into your Spicetify custom CSS (or include it in your theme),
 *   then run `spicetify apply`.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - If Spotify changes class names, inspect the DOM and update selectors accordingly.
 * - On narrow screens the ordering is reset so the layout remains natural.

/* Primary approach: push all non-queue sections after the queue */
.main-nowPlayingView-section:not(.main-nowPlayingView-queue) {
  order: 99;
}

/* Optional alternative (uncomment if the above doesn't work in your Spotify version):
   Explicitly put the queue first by giving it a negative order value.
.main-nowPlayingView-queue {
  order: -1;
}
*/

/* Reset the ordering on narrow screens to avoid layout issues */
@media (max-width: 900px) {
  .main-nowPlayingView-section:not(.main-nowPlayingView-queue),
  .main-nowPlayingView-queue {
    order: initial !important;
  }
}

/* Optional: if you want the queue to be visually emphasized, you can tweak spacing:
.main-nowPlayingView-queue {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
