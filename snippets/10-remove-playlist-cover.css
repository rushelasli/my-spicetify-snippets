/* 10 - Remove Playlist Album Cover
 *
 * Hides the large playlist/album image used in some entity headers to create a cleaner,
 * more compact header. Copy this snippet into your Spicetify custom CSS (or save
 * it as `snippets/10-remove-playlist-cover.css`) and run `spicetify apply`.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Spotify's DOM and class names may change with updates. If this stops working,
 *   inspect the header element in DevTools and update the selector accordingly.
 * - To re-enable the cover, remove or comment out the rules below and re-apply.

/* Hide the new-style entity header image container */
.main-entityHeader-imageContainer.main-entityHeader-imageContainerNew {
  display: none;
}

/* Optional: if you find spacing looks off after hiding the cover, you can
   tweak header layout (example - uncomment and adjust as needed):

   .main-entityHeader {
     padding-left: 0 !important;
   }

   Or, to hide legacy variants as well (uncomment when needed):

   .main-entityHeader-imageContainer,
   .main-entityHeader-imageContainerNew {
     display: none !important;
   }
