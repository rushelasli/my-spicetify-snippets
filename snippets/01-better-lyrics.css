/* 01 - Better Lyrics Style
 *
 * Emphasize the active lyric line and de-emphasize others.
 * - Active line: unblurred, larger, more padding.
 * - Non-active lines: slightly blurred and slightly smaller.
 * - Unsynced lines: readable (no blur), smaller padding.
 *
 * Usage: copy this file (or its contents) into your Spicetify custom CSS
 * or include it as a snippet in your workflow.
